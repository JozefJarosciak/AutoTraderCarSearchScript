# AutoTraderCarSearchScript
This Python script automates the process of searching for cars on AutoTrader.ca. It allows users to input search criteria, such as postal code, search radius, mileage, year range, and price, and returns a list of cars that match the criteria. The results are displayed in a formatted table, sorted by the best price-to-mileage ratio.
